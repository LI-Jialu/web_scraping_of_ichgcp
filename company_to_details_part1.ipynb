Therefore the BIOP seeks to create a link between life sciences and engineering to investigate jointly these fundamental fields. Teaching and education as well as research projects are organized for promoting a mutual understanding.Currently a broad range of light microscopic techniques ranging from simple wide-field imaging systems over standard point-scanning confocal microscopes up to a high-end 2-Photon-excitation microscope are available at the facility. The main idea is to teach users so that they can use the instruments independently.Additionally there is a strong competence and necessary computer power to perform image processing. The idea is to link the image analysis with the image acquisition as early as possible as this is required to answer ambitious biological questions.The microscopes and the image analysis capabilities can be used from scientists inside the EPFL as well as from visitors.The BIOP is also involved in teaching activities on the master and PhD level.
