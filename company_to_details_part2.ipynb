      "Althian Clinical Research Management Center, located in Monterrey, was founded in 2008 by a group of visionaries with more than ten years of experience working in the medical field. Owing to their profound understanding of the medical marketplace and their fortunate past liaisons with some of the true leaders of medical research, they identified the need and the value for developing a high-level research management center in Monterrey City. Created as a brand of the former company Winsett Rethman S.A. de C.V., Althian was envisioned as an organization that would truly facilitate the efforts of CROs and sponsors to run clinical trials in Mexico on an unparalleled level of efficiency and competence. In 2015, a new healthcare company, Axis Heilsa S. de R.L. de C.V., was created and Althian, keeping the same brand and experienced personnel, came to be part of this new healthcare group. This new strategy has let us reach out to even more patients so that we can offer them new opportunities of treatment that the clinical trials have to offer.It is with this kind of inspired leadership that we at Althian have come to know and understand how to successfully run clinical research trials in northern Mexico. This in-depth grasp of the economic, medical and logistical value of the area makes it possible for us to individualize each trial and adapt our resources according to the needs and requirements of our sponsors. In most cases, we build a team with some of the best diagnostic and clinical talent in Monterrey in order to achieve the objective of a specific clinical trial. As such, we are a dedicated research center, specializing in conducting phase I, II, III and IV trials in multiple medical areas and subspecialties.
